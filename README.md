# numworksRGBimg
i just made this in an afternoon and it could be better.

to use this you need python PIL for the get_pixel() function here:
https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/

just get a jpg image (a very tiny one, maybe 16x16 to be safe) and run 
it through the pyhon script, but make sure to fill in the path and width
and height.

next, copy and paste the list of rgb values into the value "s", and put in
the xy width and height here:

im going to optimize this more later, but for now its a proof of concept.
